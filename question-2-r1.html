                <h1>Question 2</h1>
            </div>
            <h2>Dan wants to improve his golf game. Every day, he practices one golf stroke for an hour, and records his practice session on video. After his practice, he watches the recording, and plans on what changes to make the next day. Assume he has no other golf instruction. Is Dan engaged in deliberate practice? Why?</h2>
            <h2 style="color: #50D8E3">Choose the option that best answers the question from the list below. Then click "Check answer" on the right.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="option-card" id="incorrect1">
            <h2>No. Deliberate practice requires feedback from an external expert, be that a human expert or an agent. Also, he is not making adjustments frequent enough</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="option-card" id="incorrect2">
            <h2>Not receiving immediate feedback may make Rajeev not yield an improvement.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="option-card" id="correct">
            <h2>No, Dan is not engaged in deliberate practice because he is nothing supervised by a teacher to diagnose errors. This is an element of the definition of deliberate practice.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="feedback-card-correct">
            <h2>Good job! You picked the best answer. Keep going to the next question or retry this one for extra credits.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="feedback-card-incorrect">
            <h2>Not quite right. Here is one of the correct answers. Retry after reading it.</h2>
            <h2 style="font-style: italic">Not exactly. To engage in deliberate practice, one must be given explicit instruction about the best method. Since Dan is simply reflecting on his own method and has never compared it with a best method given to him by an expert, this step is not met. You could perhaps argue that the second component of deliberate practice is met, he is his own teacher and diagnosis his own errors. But without the first point, this is meaningless. Finally, the third part of deliberate practice of getting informative feedback and remedial training could be argued that he's doing this for himself. But again, without being able to compare it with a best method, this is meaningless.</h2>
